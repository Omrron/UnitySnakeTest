# UnitySnakeTest
Trying to make a snake game without following a tutorial (as little as necessary). The purpose of this project is to learn the unity game engine


To do:
1) Upgrade movement function to move head then place end of snake in head's prev pos.
2) Upgrade growth function to add new segment where tail was before moving
3) Make high score visible in more places (currently only on respawn menu)
4) Start game in pause asking for start direction
